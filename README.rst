Testing

You need to create a file secret.py which has the content

::

    # DO NOT check these into git
    API_KEY = 'your api key'
    SHARED_SECRET = 'your shared secret'
    USERNAME = 'your username'
    PASSWORD = 'your password'

You have to fill in the values of your slideshare account. Then you can
run the tests with

::

    python setup.py test

Some tests assume a slideshow_id you have to be able to edit or delete,
you will have to change these values otherwise the tests will fail.
